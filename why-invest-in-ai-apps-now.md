title: Why Invest in AI Apps Now

Someone asked me: why invest in AI apps? We've seen so many money-losing internet apps struggle to break even because margins were so low. Isn't investing in AI apps repeating these mistakes? The only way out seems to be getting lucky and exiting before these apps actually show profitability. 

I think all these concerns are valid. The fact that model providers themselves are still losing money does make application economics questionable. We haven't yet seen an ideal gross margin level that an AI application should achieve to be "good enough." Even if margins stabilize at 30-50% in the short term in subscription based pricing model, there's no guarantee they'll stay there as monetization models evolve to say token based or result based pricing model.

The core concern is whether we're repeating the pattern of investing in money-losing platforms, hoping to exit before the economics catch up. It's a fair question.

But I think there are structural differences between the internet apps and AI apps in terms of profitability.

### Why AI apps can improve profitability over time

The difference comes down to how revenue and costs scale.

**Revenue**: Internet platforms needed user scale to create value. Bike-sharing needed coverage density before it was useful. Grocery ecommerce needed order volume to negotiate supplier deals. The value only emerged after massive investment in user acquisition. AI apps are different. The value is delivered from day one. Users pay when they see the app solves their problem. No network effects required, no critical mass needed.

**Costs**: Internet platform costs were structural. More users meant more bikes, more warehouses, more delivery drivers. The cost base scaled with revenue, and improving unit economics required either monopoly pricing power or degrading the user experience. AI app costs are different. The main cost is inference, and inference costs are falling 50%+ year-over-year. This trend is predictable: models are getting more efficient, and provider competition is intensifying. An AI app with 35% gross margins today could reach 55-65% in two years without changing its business model. The infrastructure is simply getting cheaper.

**Nature of burn**: Internet platforms burned money to acquire users who might eventually become valuable. The spending was speculative. AI apps burn money on inference to deliver value that users are already paying for. The question isn't "will users ever pay?" It's "will costs come down enough for the margins to work?" That's a more answerable question.

**Downside floor**: Failed internet platforms had little residual value. AI app failures still attract acquirers who want the team, the user data, or the product. Even if a company can't become a standalone giant, acquisition exits can generate returns.

So we're not suspending concerns about bad economics. We're betting that economics will improve as inference costs decline. That's a different bet than hoping to exit before a structurally broken business collapses.

### Why timing matters

The key reason I think AI apps are worth exploring now is how quickly they can gain users and real revenue.

As I mentioned earlier, AI apps deliver value from day one, unlike internet companies that derive value from network effects, or SaaS companies that derive value from tools users must learn to adopt.

Users pay for AI's results, which are intuitive and easy to measure. You try Cursor and instantly know it's good at coding. No network effects required, no learning curve to understand the tool. You see the value directly. This is why AI apps can ramp up so quickly, like Manus reaching $100M ARR within 8 months. Once users try it and see what it can do, they're willing to pay.

The natural follow-up: doesn't that mean switching costs are low? Data suggests otherwise. According to OpenRouter's [analysis](https://openrouter.ai/state-of-ai#analysis-of-llm-user-retention), when a new model is released, it has a brief window to solve a specific, previously unsolvable workload for a group of users. If it succeeds, those users form a "foundational cohort" with high, durable retention. Users don't constantly switch models; once a model solves their specific problem ("workload-model fit"), they stay due to technical and cognitive inertia. If you're already using ChatGPT, are you also regularly trying Claude, Gemini, and Grok? Do you compare results across all models for the same task? Most people don't.

I believe the same applies to apps. Once an app solves your problem well, why bother trying alternatives?

So being the first good app in a specific vertical has real value, and winners tend to ramp up fast. This is why I believe starting investing earlier matters. Look at how quickly vertical apps are achieving rapid ARR growth and market share. The window for dominant AI players to emerge in each vertical will be much shorter than in the internet or SaaS eras. Within 3 years, we may already see clear winners in most verticals.

Another first-mover advantage: the ability to gather data on user preferences. Cursor learns what code developers prefer because they see what users accept and reject. These insights aren't captured by LLM providers. And you don't need massive user numbers. You just need a small group of "hero users" (a term I learned from CreekStone) who can no longer do their work without your app. They provide the feedback needed to continuously improve the product.

Given that economics can improve as inference costs decline, and winners are emerging fast with durable retention, I think making measured bets through select managers now makes sense.
