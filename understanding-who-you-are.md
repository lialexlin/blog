Dan Koe's ["How to fix your entire life in 1 day"](https://x.com/thedankoe/status/2010751592346030461?s=20) gives you a structured procedure to reset. It's useful. But I think it all reduces to one thing: **understanding who you are**.

It sounds very simple, but it's actually very very hard, at least in my personal experience.

We all have bias. Bias comes from our experience - we could have trust issues if we were betrayed, we could tie our self-worth to achievement if that's how we got praised as kids. So when asked about who you are, most of the time you could easily give the answer "I'm the kind of person xxx / yyy".

But we rarely dig in deeper. Why do you think you're that kind of person? Why do you think you like this over that? Why do you want to set this goal? Why do you behave like this?

To dig deeper, you have to poke through the identity that you "believe", because such belief could have been constructed by your parents or early life, and is not truly who you are. And only until you truly understand who you are, you can make goals that suit you, and then find joy during the process of achieving that goal.

And I think there are two ways to understand what you really are.

### 1. You only know after you've done it

I was a finance major in college. When I was in school, all I cared about was breaking into investment banking, because it sounded like such a bright future - well paid, working in fancy offices, wearing suits, having expensive dinners with clients, advising on multi million dollar deals.

I had the wake up call during a live deal when I was in Hong Kong. We had to stay up all night to receive the orderbooks from our US team and consolidate them to our boss for them to speak with the client. When it was morning, the juniors could finally leave and take a quick nap because the next shift came in, but our Managing Director had to go to breakfast with our client to go through the orders.

It struck me - I don't want to spend 20 years to climb my way up and live this life. This experience taught me that **I value how much I control my own time. I don't want my time to be controlled by others**.

Then I joined a private equity firm, because that was the holy grail for all the investment bankers, and I was deeply excited about it and thought this was it. Private equity sounded like a group of people superior to investment bankers.

But then I learned a different lesson. Private equity is an asset class that lacks liquidity, meaning assets are, most of the time, not properly priced based on current market conditions. This creates a significant information gap.

If we define that the source of truth is the real problem and general public's perception of those problems, then the founder is the closest to such truth, followed by the general partner (who make the investments), then the limited partner (who give money for those GP to spend), and in many cases these LPs have their own LP as well. Every layer you go further, you get further away from the truth, because the information gets missed during the transmission process and each layer will filter it to make it look better.

The structural challenge is then - to succeed in this industry, you cannot just be "right about investment". You have to be exceptionally good with people. Because whether you're right or wrong will only be proven in 3-5 years, and by then no one cares what you said before.

My personal lesson was that **I'm obsessed with getting closer to truth and building** - understanding how things and the world work through first principle thinking and how to apply them.

But, these two lessons can only be learnt after I've done these things. If I never got into these industries, I would not have learned it about myself. I "imagined" that these are the things that I want, but they weren't.

So the first way is to try it, and then you'll know if you like it.

### 2. Ruthlessly question yourself

The second approach is to question yourself over and over and over, until the truth surfaces.

For example, why do you want to become a founder so much that it's making you anxious? > Because I want to build what I believe and control my own time.

Why do you want to build what you believe and control your own time? > Because I want to do things because I think it makes sense, not because I'm told to.

Why do you want to do things that you think makes sense? > Because I'm frustrated when having to do things that don't make sense, and only doing things that I think makes sense gives me a sense of achievement and not wasting my time.

Why do you care about not wasting time? > Because if I feel I'm wasting time, I'm not getting closer to who I want to be, and that makes me anxious.

Why do you feel the rush to be who you want to be today? Don't you understand that building things take time? > I don't know.

This is where I had to sit with it. Eventually I realized: clarity arrived before certainty. I know what I want, but I don't yet know how to get there. The gap is uncomfortable, so I try to close it with speed. Then the next question: why do I find my current constraints psychologically intolerable? It can continue to go on and on.

This kind of loop stops in a place where you don't have a quick, direct, instinctive answer. That's where you should poke through. AI is actually very helpful here - I have these discussions with GPT all the time.

It's really when you go deep deep down into your heart, and you find those things that you don't have a direct instinctive answer for - those are the things that you don't know about yourself.

### What happens after I understand who I am?

To me, the most difficult part is understanding who you are. After you get through that, you naturally know what your options are.

You know why you perceive, think and react to things in a certain way. You know what the most important things to you in life are.

This understanding can change over time as we grow. So constantly refresh your view of yourself whenever you're setting your next goal and starting the next journey.
