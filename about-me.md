### About me 

Finance professional by training, entrepreneur by ambition. I spend my days evaluating private equity investments and exploring how AI reshapes the way we work. Outside work: marathon and triathlon training, two cats, happily married.

### My belief and life principles

- Be curious, not clever. Seek truth through first principles.
- Be kind and humble. Seek honest feedback and criticism.
- Build compounding systems to solve problems, not ad hoc fixes.
- Think long-term in a short-term world. Start small, iterate fast.
- Trust and relationships come first. Transactions and profit come next.
- Stay self-aware. Watch for biases, blind spots, and bad habits.
- Physical health: consistent sleep, regular exercise, proper nutrition.
- Mental health: let go of what I can't control, invest in deep relationships.
- Winners focus on winning, losers focus on winners.
- Pursue "freedom from" over "freedom to."
