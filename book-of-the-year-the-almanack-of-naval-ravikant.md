Naval's ideas fundamentally changed how I think and behave. I finished this book and immediately shared it with a bunch of friends.

What struck me most about his take on wealth creation: it's not about finding a lucrative business. It's about understanding who you are, what's your edge, and playing the game that fits both. No one can compete with you on being you.

His emphasis on clear thinking, on understanding physics and fundamental knowledge (not just business), led me to adopt first-principles thinking in almost everything. I've since started learning physics.

But perhaps the largest impact was his explanation of happiness: it's not something you chase, but the state when nothing feels missing. To be happy, you either lower your expectations (which probably shouldn't be so high in the first place), or you work on yourself to achieve what you actually want.

Lastly, freedom. Not "freedom to" do anything, but "freedom from" anything. Once you reach that state of internal freedom and peace, you've cracked the game of life.

Below are the quotes I loved most, organized into five themes.

### Wealth creation 

- "You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale. Because if society knows how to create those things, they wouldn't need you. They would already be stamped out."
- "Specific knowledge is knowledge you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else and replace you. Knowledge only you know or only a small set of people knows is going to come out of your passions and your hobbies."
- "No one can compete with you on being you. Most of life is a search for who and what needs you the most. If you are fundamentally building and marketing something that is an extension of who you are, no one can compete with you."
- There are three kind of leverages in life, "Forget rich versus poor, white-collar versus blue. It's now leveraged versus un-leveraged": 
	- Labor (oldest, weakest): "Not a great one in the modern world."
	- Capital: "Every time you make a decision, you multiply it with money."
	- Code/Media (newest, most democratic): "Permissionless. Products with no marginal cost of replication."
- "Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable."
- "You're not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity."

### Clear thinking

- As an extension of this book, I also read "The Great Mental Models Vol. 1: General Thinking Concepts" by Shane Parrish, which I was also deeply inspired by the mental models that it introduced in the book. 
- "The number one thing clouding us from being able to see reality is we have preconceived notions of the way it should be."
- "What you feel tells you nothing about the facts—it merely tells you something about your estimate of the facts."
- "I think being successful is just about not making mistakes. It's not about having correct judgment. It's about avoiding incorrect judgments."
- "A contrarian reasons independently from the ground up and resists pressure to conform. Cynicism is easy. Mimicry is easy. Optimistic contrarians are the rarest breed.
- "I would rather understand the basics really well than memorize all kinds of complicated concepts I can't stitch together."
- "When solving problems: the older the problem, the older the solution."
- "Read the greats in math, science, and philosophy. Ignore your contemporaries and news."

### Happiness as default state

- "Happiness is the state when nothing is missing. When nothing is missing, your mind shuts down and stops running into the past or future."
- "Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want."
- "I try not to have more than one big desire in my life at any given time, and I also recognize it as the axis of my suffering."
- "It's way more important to perfect your desires than to try to do something you don't 100 percent desire."
- "The idea you're going to change something in the outside world, and that is going to bring you the peace, everlasting joy, and happiness you deserve, is a fundamental delusion we all suffer from."
- "A happy person isn't someone who's happy all the time. It's someone who effortlessly interprets events in such a way that they don't lose their innate peace."
- "The most important trick to being happy is to realize happiness is a skill you develop and a choice you make."
- "Happiness, love, and passion aren't things you find—they're choices you make."
- "In any situation in life, you always have three choices: you can change it, you can accept it, or you can leave it."

### Freedom, identity & games

- "Retirement is when you stop sacrificing today for an imaginary tomorrow. When today is complete, in and of itself, you're retired."
- "At some point, these are all just games. These are games where the outcome really stops mattering once you see through the game. Any end goal will just lead to another goal. We just play games in life. The real winners are the ones who step out of the game entirely, who don't even play the game, who rise above it."
- "Politics, academia, and social status are all zero-sum games. Positive-sum games create positive people."
- "In a long-term game, it seems that everybody is making each other rich. And in a short-term game, it seems like everybody is making themselves rich."
- "Our egos are constructed in our formative years. Then, we spend the rest of our life trying to make our ego happy."
- "Memory and identity are burdens from the past preventing us from living freely in the present."
- "Now, the freedom I'm looking for is internal freedom. Freedom from reaction. Freedom from feeling angry. Freedom from being sad."
- "I only believe in peer relationships. I don't believe in hierarchical relationships. If I can't treat someone like a peer and if they can't treat me like peer, I just don't want to interact with them."
- "When working, surround yourself with people more successful than you. When playing, surround yourself with people happier than you."

### Luck and reputation 

- Four types of luck:
	1. Blind luck: Completely out of your control
	2. Hustle luck: "Running around creating opportunities, generating energy"
	3. Skill luck: "You become very good at spotting luck. You notice when a lucky break happens in your field."
	4. Destiny luck: "You build a unique character, a unique brand, a unique mindset, which causes luck to find you."
- "Hope luck finds you → Hustle until you stumble into it → Prepare the mind and be sensitive to chances others miss → Become the best at what you do. Opportunity will seek you out. Luck becomes your destiny."
- "One of the things important to make money is having a reputation that makes people do deals through you."
- "Your character and your reputation are things you can build, which will let you take advantage of opportunities other people may characterize as lucky."
- "Karma is just you, repeating your patterns, virtues, and flaws until you finally get what you deserve."
