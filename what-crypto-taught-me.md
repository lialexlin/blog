### How I got into the rabbit hole

In 2021, when I was 27, as part of the due diligence of an investment, I reviewed the first crypto project that I'd ever seen: Flow chain and Dapper Labs.

Dapper Labs had the engineer who helped introduce the ERC-721 protocol, which made Non-Fungible Tokens ("NFT") possible, and had prior success with Crypto Kitties. They had just introduced NBA Topshot, which brought player cards online and tradable. Their token was priced at $0.1 per token in the private round, and soared to $30+ when the market got hot about NFTs. It seemed very exciting.

As part of my diligence, I got introduced to one of the largest apps on Flow, founded by a Taiwan team. I didn't fully get what they were building, but it all sounded exciting and techy, and at an "attractive valuation." I made a small personal investment.

It quickly popped to 25x+ after listing. I refreshed the screen a few times to make sure it was real. I had never witnessed any return like this before.

This was it, I thought. A generational opportunity. Crypto was a groundbreaking technology with significant impact to society (blockchain, DeFi, NFT), and if I worked hard enough to understand the technology and get connected in the space, there was a chance for me to get 100x returns and get rich fast.

Over the next 1-2 years, I spent a lot of time understanding the fundamental technology of blockchain: reading the Bitcoin whitepaper, understanding how consensus is reached in a decentralized manner, understanding Ethereum's scaling roadmap through roll-ups and danksharding, and studying all the popular DeFi apps' mechanisms and tokenomics, trying to understand what value blockchain was creating.

I did everything I thought I was supposed to do. It didn't matter.

There were a few mistakes that fundamentally changed how I think and behave. 

### Early success doesn't always repeat

I got carried away by the 25x investment when it was listed and thought I could replicate that success.

But here's what actually happened with that 25x: the token price collapsed significantly after the first few vestings. After the 3rd vesting, the company reached out asking me not to sell. I complied. I regretted it. In the end, I only managed to get back cost from the first 2 vests.

Over about 2 years of actively researching crypto and engaging with investors and projects in the space, I never saw another similar opportunity to get a 10x+ return. And very rarely did I see any investors successfully exit their investment at 10x on any project, even among the largest VCs who have the best access to deals.

The first 25x deeply wired my brain to believe that "10x is very possible and I just need to work harder to get it." But in reality, 10x deals were so rare. It was not that I didn't work hard enough to find them. It was that they were so few.

I only saw this clearly after I stopped following crypto. When I stepped back and looked at the full picture, the pattern was obvious. But while I was in it, I kept believing the next 10x was just around the corner.

Lesson #1: Don't get biased by early success. It doesn't guarantee that success will repeat. Update your view continuously based on what you see, not your first impression.

### Understand the game you're playing

One of the many reasons that crypto investments don't work, in my view, is the fundamental conflict of interest between founder and investor.

There's no other asset class in the world that allows founders to capitalize on their startup so quickly and massively like crypto. A founder could raise millions of dollars at a pre-defined valuation regardless of whether the product or service they're providing is actually solving any meaningful problems, and easily cash out millions of dollars if they know the most efficient way to push their token to exchanges.

If you can get $10M in 12 months as a founder, why would you commit yourself to build something truly meaningful that takes 10 years?

In crypto, momentum and speculation are almost everything. If your token price is not soaring, what problem you're solving and how good you are at solving it don't matter at all. Instead of chasing value creation, founders chase token pumps, market attention, and capital.

So what actually creates returns in this game? Getting connected to whoever can pop up the price. Not understanding who is making a better product.

Who wins in this dynamic? The large exchanges with pricing power (basically Binance), followed by the market makers who have visibility into the actual supply-demand of tokens, then the founders who know how much value they can extract from the projects, then the VCs, then general public.

Lesson #2: Understand what creates edge in the game you're playing. Deep knowledge doesn't help if the game rewards something else entirely.

### Walk away if it's not your game

During those two years, I questioned whether all this research would pay off. Despite having doubts, I told myself I was just not working hard enough.

But what finally made me quit wasn't the lack of returns. It was seeing how the game actually worked from the inside.

I became a part-time consultant to one of the very first and largest apps on a famous layer one blockchain. My involvement included advising on product development and structuring the key themes for fundraising.

During that process, I had deep engagement with the project team, the layer one blockchain's foundation, and many global VCs. What I saw disgusted me:

- VCs doing almost no real diligence
- Foundation team members "advising" their leaders to invest resources in the project just to get advisory tokens for themselves
- The founding team telling stories about features they had no intention of building, and lying about raising money from investors they hadn't actually closed
- Everyone treating this as completely normal
- Exchanges demanding significant capital and benefits just to list the token

I realized: to succeed in crypto, you have to be willing to do whatever it takes to pump the price and keep the momentum. You have to say and believe in things that are probably not true.

I decided this is not who I am, and this is not the game I want to play.

Lesson #3: We are all different people, and we won't be good at every game. Choosing wisely which game to play is much more important than working hard. I don't like speculation, and I'm bad at recognizing who can pump the price, so I should not play in crypto. 

### Is AI the next crypto?

After these reflections, the most important thing is how to apply these takeaways to the journey ahead.

I'm in another rabbit hole now. This time it's AI. When I first used Claude Code to successfully write code to call an API, it felt like the 25x moment in crypto. I have no background in coding. And yet here I was, building things. I'm deeply excited, and I think this is the future.

But I've felt this before.

So I'm trying to apply the lessons:

**On early success (Lesson #1):** Am I getting carried away again? The first time I got AI to do something I couldn't do myself, my brain immediately went to "this changes everything." Maybe it does. But I remember how the 25x wired my brain to expect 10x everywhere. I'm watching myself for the same pattern.

**On understanding the game (Lesson #2):** What actually creates edge in AI? Is it access to the best models? Building the best applications? Understanding the technology deeply? Or something else entirely? I don't have an answer yet, but I'm asking the question this time instead of assuming my approach will work.

**On walking away (Lesson #3):** Is this my game? Here I'm more optimistic. Unlike crypto, AI seems to reward building real things that solve real problems. The incentives feel more aligned. But I'm staying alert for warning signs that the game is different from what I think.

Instead of going all in, I'm staying skeptical and continuously testing AI as a user myself. What are the strongest arguments against the large labs' claims that "AGI is near" and "white collar jobs will disappear"? What will have to happen for us to get from where we are today to the fully AI-powered automated workflow future?

I don't have the answers. But this time, I'm asking the questions before I commit. Maybe AI will be my next 25x. Maybe it won't. But at least this time I'll know why.
