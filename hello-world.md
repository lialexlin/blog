This is the first article on this blog. It demonstrates how markdown content renders with the minimalist design.

## A Subheading

Here is some body text with **bold** and *italic* formatting. You can also include `inline code` within paragraphs.

> This is a blockquote for emphasized passages or quotes from other sources.

### Lists

Here's a simple list:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

And a numbered list:

1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three

### Code Example

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

That's all for now.
